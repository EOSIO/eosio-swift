This library is a required dependency and contains fundamental classes that power following libraries:

* [Softkey Signature Provider](https://github.com/EOSIO/eosio-swift-softkey-signature-provider) (sign transactions)
* [ABIEOS Serialization Provider](https://github.com/EOSIO/eosio-swift-abieos-serialization-provider) (broadcast to blockchain)
* [Vault](https://github.com/EOSIO) (manage keys)

*All product and company names are trademarks™ or registered® trademarks of their respective holders. Use of them does not imply any affiliation with or endorsement by them.*

## Basic Usage

To communicate with blockchain you need to build a `transaction` class instance. It has 3 necessary components:

* `RPCProvider` (communicate with `nodeos`)
* `serializationProvider` (convert `JSON` to `binary` and vice-versa)
* `signatureProvider` (add a signature)

```
var transaction = EosioTransaction()

transaction.rpcProvider = yourRPCProvider
transaction.serializationProvider = yourSerializationProvider
transaction.signatureProvider = yourSignatureProvider

// then you call
transaction.signAndBroadcast()
```

To learn how to use the library refer to [Example App](https://github.com/EOSIO/eosio-reference-ios-authenticator-app).

## Contents of the library

`Transaction class`

* creates, signs and broadcasts transactions

`Remote Procedure Call (RPC) provider`

* communicates with `nodeos` (aka blockchain endpoint) with convenient methods

`EosioAbiProvider`

* wraps `Remote Procedure Call (RPC) provider` with convenience methods

As well the following: `EosioAbiProviderProtocol`, `EosioRpcProviderProtocol`, `EosioSerializationProviderProtocol` and  `EosioSignatureProviderProtocol`

## Installation
It hasn't been decided if this library is going to be destributed as a `pod` with all other dependencies included. Or people would have to install other dependencies (like `eosio-swift-softkey-signature-provider`) separately and store them in the same folder.
